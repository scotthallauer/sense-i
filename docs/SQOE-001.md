There are several variations of this module, and within each, also
several different ways a function or step in the process can be
performed. Each industry has a unique set of rules and procedures that
implement the best way to achieve a result. So while the process
flowchart above might look simple, it is within each of the functions in
the module that unique requirements for the industry and for each
company are implemented.
