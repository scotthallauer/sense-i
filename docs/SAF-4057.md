## Step-by-step Guideline
___ 

This procedure describes how you can review a list of outstanding
invoices from Suppliers and select specific invoices to be paid using
the Bulk Supplier Payment function.  

1.  Click on the **Finance** item on the Main Menu.  

2.  Click on the **Suppliers** item on the Drop Down Menu.  

3.  Click on the **Mark For Payment** item on the side menu.

The system will display the Mark Installments For Bulk Payments
screen. This screen lists all of the Outstanding Invoices from
Suppliers that must still be paid.

You will notice that you can display invoices for a specific supplier
only if you wish by entering the Account Code for the Supplier in the
Supplier Code field.  

You can also control which outstanding invoices the system displays
according to their Due Date by using the From Date and To Date fields.  

In the grid at the bottom underneath the Search Panel, you can see the
details of all outstanding invoices. The two images below show the
columns in the grid, together with descriptions of each field, in more
detail.

4.  The system displays the type of transaction in the Transaction Type
    field. If the payment to the supplier is due as a deposit on a
    Purchase Order, then the Transaction Type displayed will be PO (for
    Purchase Order). If the payment to the supplier is due as a payment
    on an Invoice, then the type will be PO Invoice (for Purchase Order
    Invoice). A Journal will show a JNL and a Credit Note as PO CN.  

5.  The system displays the number for the transaction in the
    Transaction No field. If the Transaction Type is a PO Invoice, then
    ideally the Transaction Number should be Supplier's original invoice 
	number. This is the number you entered into the Transaction No field.  

6.  The date on which the transaction was created is displayed in the
    Transaction Date field. This is the Effective Date you entered into
    the system when you captured the Purchase Order Invoice.  

7.  The system displays any reference you captured against the Purchase
    Order Invoice in the Reference field.  

8.  The system displays the payment terms that have been used to
    calculate when the payment is due on the invoice in the Payment
    Terms field.

9.  The system displays the date on which payment is due for each
    invoice in the Payment Due Date. The system calculates this by
    adding the Payment Terms Rule to the Transaction Date.  

_So, for example, if the Transaction Date is the 1st of April and
the terms are 30 days from invoice, then the Payment Due Date will be
the 30th of April. If the payment terms are 30 days from Statement
and the Statement Date is the last day of April, then the Payment Due
Date will be the 30th of May._  

10. The system displays the Outstanding Amount. This is the difference
    between the Original Amount and the Payments To Date made and
    allocated to the invoice.  

11. The system displays the Date on which payment must be made to take
    discount in the Discount Date column.  

12. The system displays the Eligible Discount %. The Eligible Discount
    is calculated on whether the Discount Date is in the future or not.
    If the Discount Date is in the past and the payment has not been
    made the Eligible Discount will change to 0.00.  

13. The system displays the value of the discount you can deduct from
    the payment in the Eligible Discount Amount column.  

14. The system displays the Original Invoice Amount. This allows you to
    verify information on the screen against printed or electronic
    copies of the original invoice. Payments might have been made and
    allocated to an invoice which would reduce the Outstanding Amount
    due on the invoice. By also showing the Original Amount the system
    allows you to easily cross check information in the database with
    original documents.  

15. The system displays the Original Discount allowable. If the Discount
    Date is in the future then the Original Discount and the Eligible
    Discount will be the same.  

16. The system displays the sum of all payments made so far and
    allocated to each invoice in the Payments to Date column.  

17. The system displays the sum of all discount taken so far in the
    Discount to Date column.  

18. The system displays the Payment Status assigned to each transaction
    in the list in the Payment Status column.  

*The system enables you to control which invoices are included and
which are excluded from Bulk Payment Runs.*  

*Remember to that select multiple invoices that are adjacent to each
other, click the first invoice, then hold down the shift key on your
key board and click the last invoice you wish to select. The system
will mark all rows containing the invoices you have selected in pale
yellow.*  

*To select non-adjacent invoices, hold down the control key and click
any invoices you wish to select. The system will mark selected rows in
yellow and leave unselected rows in white.*

19. To decide which invoices to include in a Bulk Supplier Payment Run,
    you can click on one or more invoices in the list and then click
    either the Mark Pay button to set the Payment Status to "Pay" (which
    means they will be included in the next Bulk Payment made for the
    supplier).  

20. You can click the Mark Hold button which will place the invoice on
    Hold and prevent it from being included in the next payment run.  

21. You can select one or more rows and click the Clear Mark button if
    you wish to remove invoices from a payment selection.  

22. Repeat the above steps until you have decided which of the due
    invoices will be included for payment in the next Supplier Payment
    Run.  

23. Click the Close button on the form bar once you are finished.  

24. The next step in the process is to Generate Supplier Payments using
    the Supplier Payment Run function.  

**This is the end of the procedure**
