## Credit columns

Note that you can choose to include either only Posted Transactions,
Un-Posted Transactions or Both Posted and Un-posted Transactions in
the calculated closing balance for each account in the Trial Balance.

8.  To select which option to use, click on the option you wish to use
    from the list displayed in the Posted field. You should, when

    part of the process of finalizing your company's financial
    statements.
