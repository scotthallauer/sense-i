## View Open Instalments (ACP-007)
### Procedure Guideline
___  

Instalments are either amounts due to suppliers as deposits against
Purchase Orders or amounts due on invoices or statements received from
suppliers. The Open Instalment screen in Sense-i displays a list and
the details of each of these amounts.

Note that all transactions that have been fully settled are excluded
from the list.

1.  Click on Finance on the main menu.  

2.  Click Suppliers on the drop down menu.  

3.  Click AP (for Accounts Payable) Open Instalment on the side menu.

The system will display the Accounts Payable Open Instalment screen.
This screen will enable you to view a list and the details of all
instalments that remain unpaid to your suppliers. The system does not
display any information in this screen until you have entered a date
in the To Date field.

**Using the Search Options in the Search Panel**  

4.  Click on the To Date field and then select a closing date for the
    report from the drop down calendar.  

5.  Then click the Search button on the form bar.  

The system will display a list of all unpaid instalments that were due
for payment before the To Date you entered in step 4 above.

6.  Click on the Payment Due Date column to have the system sort all the
    instalments in the screen in date order.  

7.  If you change the To Date in the search frame at the top of the
    screen to an earlier date and then click the Search button again,
    you will notice that any instalments that were on the screen and
    were due for payment after the To Date you have now entered, will no
    longer appear on the screen.  

Setting the To Date enables you to immediately view a list of all
payments outstanding and due to a specific date. Remember that all
transactions that have been fully settled are excluded from the list.

8.  You can filter the list of instalments in the screen to show only
    those instalments that are outstanding for a specific supplier. To
    do this, enter the supplier's account code in the Supplier Code
    field in the search panel. You can also click on the three-dot
    button in the Supplier Code field and search for a specific supplier
    by name using the pop-up Select Supplier window.  

9.  Clicking the Show All option will cause the system to list all
    transactions for the selected customer that occur within the From
    Date and the To Date selected in the search panel. The "Show All"
    option will also display the details of each instalment, including
    the Cancelled Value of each transaction as a separate row. When the
    Show All remains unchecked, then the system combines the value of
    the original instalment with the value of any cancelled transactions
    and displays only the net amount outstanding for each transaction on
    a single row. You will notice a "+" sign appears next to the
    Transaction Type on each row where more detail exists for a specific
    transaction.  

10. Clicking the Show Applied option will cause the system to list the
    details of any payments that have been allocated to each of
    partially paid instalments.  

**Understanding the Information in the Screen**

The system displays a comprehensive list of information about each of
the outstanding instalments in the various columns on the screen.

11. The supplier's account code is displayed in the Code column.  

12. The name of the supplier is displayed in the Supplier Name column.  

13. The transaction type that caused the instalment is displayed in the
    Transaction Type column.  

The instalment can be caused by a deposit that needs be paid when
placing a Purchase Order, then the Transaction Type will be PO or\...  

The instalment can be caused by an invoice received from a supplier,
then the Transaction Type will be PO Invoice.  

14. The system displays the transaction number in the Transaction No
    column. This allows you to find the Purchase Order or Purchase Order
    Invoice that has caused the instalment to be created.  

15. The system displays the date of the transaction in the Transaction
    Date column. This is not the date on which the payment is due but
    rather the date on which either the Purchase Order or the Purchase
    Order Invoice was created.  

16. Any additional reference number, such as an internal order number or
    job number that was captured on the Purchase Order or Purchase Order
    Invoice is displayed in the Reference Number column.  

17. The system displays the Term Detail Name in the Payment Terms
    column. This is the rule in the payment terms that created the
    instalment displayed in the list.

18. The system displays the date on which the instalment is due to be
    paid in the Payment Due Date column.  

19. The system displays the amount still to be paid, that is the
    Original Instalment Amount -- Payments Made To Date, in the
    Outstanding Amount column.  

20. If any discount is available to be taken for early payment, the
    system displays the date by which payment must be made to qualify
    for the discount in the Discount Date column.  

21. The system calculates the discount available as a percentage of the
    total instalment and displays this in the Eligible Discount %
    column. Note that the Eligible Discount is based on what discount
    can taken if the payment is made prior to the Discount Date. The
    Eligible Discount % changes to 0 if a payment is late.  

22. The system displays the value of the discount available in the
    Eligible Discount column.  

23. The system displays the number of days to go before the payment is
    due. If the payment is late, this figure will be a negative value.

24. The system displays the original amount of the instalment in the
    Original Amount column.  

25. The system displays the original discount amount in the Original
    Discount column.  

26. The system displays the total value of the payments made and
    allocated to the instalment in the Payments To Date column.  

27. The system displays the total value of the discounts taken against
    the instalment in the Discount To Date column.  

You can use the normal techniques for displaying the information in
the screen in a way that suits your purpose to sort and filter
instalment details.  

**This is the end of this procedure.**
