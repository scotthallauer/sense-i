## Step-by-step Guideline
___  

The SEMS System allows you to define a set of standard recurring
bank charge and interest items that appear regularly on your bank
statement and to link these charges to a General Ledger account in
order to simplify and speed up their capture in your cashbooks.  

1.  Click on **Finance** on the main menu.  

2.  Then click the **Settings** menu item on the drop down menu.

3.  Then select the **Bank Charge Items** menu option.

The system will open a screen titled "**Maintain Bank Charge Items.**"
This screen allows you to define a list of standard items you will
capture in your various bank accounts each month. The list of bank
charge items is shared across all your various bank accounts.

### Add Bank Charge Item  

1.  To add a new Bank Charge Item, click the **Add** button on the form bar.

The system will open a screen titled "**Add New Bank Charges.**"  
This screen allows you to define a **Name** that **describes the Bank Charge**,
usually this is the same as the wording appearing on the Bank
Statements you receive and the system allows you to link the Bank
Charge Item to a specific account in the General Ledger.

    **Internet Bank Fee** and so on.
