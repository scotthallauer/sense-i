## Step-by-step Guideline
___  

1.  Click on the Finance option on the Main Menu.  

2.  Then click the Journal item on the drop down menu.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-4030a/image1.jpg)

The system will open a screen titled "Maintain Journal." This screen
lists all of the individual Journal Transactions that have been posted
in the company's database and that match the criteria specified in the
Search Panel at the top of the screen.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-4030a/image3.jpg)  

The columns on the Maintain Journal screen display key information
about each Journal that you can use to find and review each Journal
without opening the transaction in detail.

3.  The system displays the effective date for each Journal that has
    been captured in the system. The effective date is the date on which
    the Journal Transaction will impact the Supplier's Account and
    account balance.  

It is possible to back date a Journal in the system provided the
Effective Date does not precede the latest Reconciliation Date for the
account and that the Accounting Period related to the Effective Date
is still open in the General Ledger.  

4.  The system displays Transaction Number assigned to each Journal in
    the Trans No field.  

5.  The system displays the name of the Supplier for whom the Journal
    has been captured in the Party Name field.  

6.  The system displays Supplier's Account Code in the Account Code
    field.  

7.  If the Journal Debits the Supplier's Account Balance, the system
    will display the Financial Value of the Journal in the Debit column.  

8.  If the Journal Credits the Supplier's Account Balance, the system
    will display the Financial Value of the Journal in the Credit
    column.  

9.  The system displays the Balance of the Journal Account in the
    Balance column.  

10. The system displays the Type of Journal in the Type column.

The system posts a Journal to deal with any Settlement Discount taken
against a Supplier's Account with a system created Discount Journal.
Such Journals show in the Maintain Journal screen with the type of
**"Discount."**  

If the Journal is a manually created Journal, then the system displays
the Journal Type as **"Journal."**  

11. The system displays the status of each Journal in the Status column.

12. The system displays the Reconciliation Status in the Party Reconcile
    column. If the Transaction has been included in a Supplier
    Reconciliation, then the system will display a ï€¹ in the Party
    Reconcile column. Reconciled Journals cannot be modified. If the
    Journal has not been included in a Supplier Reconciliation, then the
    check box in the Party Reconcile column will be blank.  

13. Any Reference entered on a Journal will be displayed in the
    Reference column. Usually a Journal Reference would contain an
    external document such as a Supplier's Voucher or Journal number.  

14. The system displays any comments entered against the Journal in the
    Notes field.  

15. The system displays the date on which the Journal was captured in
    the Capture Date column.  

16. The system displays the name of the user who captured the journal in
    the Capture Opr column.

27. You need to select a Transaction Type. The Transaction Type

:::note
You should not use the Journal function to correct errors made with
capturing invoices, credit notes, payments and refunds. The Sense-i
system is sufficiently robust to allow you to delete transactions
under certain conditions. You can delete any active invoice, credit
note, payment and refund provided the Suppliers Account is not
reconciled, the Bank Account referencing the payments and refunds is
not reconciled, no subsequent transactions are linked to the
transaction you are trying to delete and the transaction you are
trying to correct has not been retrieved to the General Ledger.  
If you
have made an error and wish to correct, first check to see if these
conditions have not yet been imposed. If they have not, rather delete
the mistaken transaction to prevent your accounting records from
becoming clogged with mistakes and corrections.  

The Sense-i transaction
controls and audit trail reports will maintain the integrity of your
accounting information even if you delete a mistaken and unlinked open
transaction. Think of it as if the transaction has not yet been posted
while these conditions are still open.  

Only if the above conditions have been imposed and you cannot delete
an error transaction should you capture a journal for the purposes of
correcting an account. Journal should not be used for correcting
mistakes but rather for posting transactions that cannot be captured
using normal transaction. Journals should be used for capturing
information related to paying interest on overdue accounts for
example, or being charged a penalty for late completion or mistakes
with items supplied.

**This is the end of the procedure.**
