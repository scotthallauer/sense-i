## Procedure Guideline

### Introduction

**What is the Purpose of this procedure?**

The purpose of this procedure is to describe the steps you need to
take to generate a report of that lists all transactions that have
occurred between the Company and its Customers. This document, called
a Customer Statement, is generated for each customer and sent to each
customer to provide them with a guide for making payments to the
company by showing them what transactions have been captured and what
transactions are due to be paid.

**When would you use this procedure?**

You would use this procedure either during the course of a month if
you were querying the status of a customer's account and then at the
end of the month you would generate statements for all customers to
advise them what payments they will need to make during the coming
period.

You will notice that as you enter the screen there is no information
displayed. This prevents the system from running unnecessary queries
and instead you need to enter some information in the search panel at
the top of the screen before the system will display any information
in the report.  

### Search Options  

**Using the Search Options in the Search Panel**

    Statement screen to show only those transactions that belong to a
    specific CUSTOMER GROUP. To do this select one Customer Group from

    specific customer. To do this, enter the customer's account code in

    the three-dot button in the Customer Code field and search for a
    specific customer by name using the pop-up Select Customer window.  

6.  You can choose to view only those transactions that occur AFTER a
    specific date. To do so select the starting date from the drop down
    calendar that is displayed in the From Date field.
