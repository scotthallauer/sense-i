### Payment for Sundry

**Entering a Sundry Payment**  

1.	Click **Add** on the **Maintain Bank Transactions** form bar.

1.  To enter a Sundry Payment, click the **Payment for Sundry** option on the
    drop down list of menu items.  

1.  The system will display a screen titled **Add New Sundry Supplier** Payment.  
	This screen will enable you to enter the details of the payment being
    made so that it can be posted to the bank account and later to the
    general ledger.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-4015/image6.jpg)  

4.  Enter the name of the party to whom the payment is being made in the
    Sundry Name field. As you type in the party's name the system will
    display a list of existing parties with matching names. This enables
    you to quickly select the name of someone to whom you have
    previously posted a payment and also to analyse payments made
    against various parties. Please ensure that you are entering party
    names correctly to prevent un-necessary duplications from being
    entered in the system.

1.  In the payment method field select the type of the transaction from
    the three-dot pop up list of bank transaction types. This could be
    either; Cheque, EFT or Cash.

1.  Enter a Transaction Number in the Transaction No field. Note that
    you can set the system to automatically generate transaction numbers
    to save you time.

1.  Select the date on which the payment is being made from the
    drop-down calendar in the Effective Date field. You can also type
    the date in this field using the format of yyyy-mm-dd. The Effective
    Date will be used by the system for assigning the transaction to a
    financial period. (For more on Financial Periods, see the procedure
    titled Maintain Financial Periods in the General Ledger module.)

1.  Enter the total amount being paid in the Transaction Amount field.
    This is the amount that will appear on the bank statement and in the
    cashbook. Note: if there is discount applicable, you will enter this
    in the discount column and the system will then use that amount to
    calculate the total amount. The amount you enter in the Transaction
    Amount field however must be the net amount of the payment as it
    will appear on the bank statement for the selected bank account.

1.  The system will display the total amount that you have allocated to
    accounts in the General Ledger in the Allocated field.

1.  The system will display the difference between the total amount
    being paid and the amount that has been allocated to accounts in the
    General Leader in the Unallocated field.

1.  Type a reference in the Reference field. This should be the invoice
    number on the document you have received from the party to whom you
    are processing the payment.

1.  If you wish to add any note to the payment, type this in the Notes
    field.

Next you need to allocate the payment or receipt to one or more
general ledger accounts. You would do this to break up the details of
the payment or receipt into greater detail so that you can analyse the
actual expenditure or income in the general ledger. For example, if
you were capturing a payment made to a travel agent for business
travel, you might want to split the payment up into Airfare,
Accommodation and Car Hire. Of course you do not need to do this and
can simply assign the transaction to a single general ledger account.  

To enter the details of each payment and receipt you need to complete
the following fields. You can press the tab key to move the cursor
from one field to the next. If you press the tab key in the final
column or field the system will create a new row into which you can
enter different information from the preceding row.  

13. Click the Add button at the top of the form.

14. The system will add a blank row to the detail section of the Sundry
    Bank Transaction screen.  

15. You can either type in an account code from the General Ledger Chart
    of Accounts in the Account Code field if you know what it is, or you
    can select an Account from the General Ledger using the Chart of
    Accounts lookup screen.  

16. Click the three dot button in the Account Code field to view this
    list. You can search for a specific account using either the type of
    Statement, the Account Group, the Account Code or the Account Name.  

27. Once you have the account to which you wish to post this transaction
    displayed in the list, click on the account and then click the
    Select button.  

The system will close the Select Account window and display the Code
and Name of the Account you have selected in the row.

18. Copy the Reference from the header into each row.  

19. Enter the Exclusive Amount (that is the amount without payment) in
    the Bank Exclusive field.  

20. Select the appropriate Tax Type applicable to this transaction. Note
    if there is no VAT Number on the invoice for which you are
    processing the payment then this should be VAT Exclusive.  

21. The system will display the Tax Rate and Amount in the Tax % and Tax
    Amount fields.  

22. And the system will add the Tax Amount to the Bank Exclusive Amount
    and show the Total allocated to this General Ledger Account in the
    Bank Inclusive field.  

23. If you need to allocate the payment to more than one General Ledger
    Account, then press the down arrow to create a new row and repeat
    steps 18 to 25 for each Allocation you need to make.  

24. When you have completely allocated the payment and the Unallocated
    Amount in the header is 0.00, click the Save button.  

25. Repeat the above steps to process any other sundry payment you need
    to make.  

**This is the end of this procedure.**
