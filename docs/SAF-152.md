The system will open a screen titled **"Maintain Purchase Order Receipt."**  
This screen lists all of the Purchase Orders Receipts (also
sometimes called Goods Received Notes) that have already been captured
in the system within the From and To Date specified in the Search
Panel. Note that you can change the information displayed in this list
by changing the dates and other information in the Search Criteria
Panel above the list of orders.

3.  Click on the Purchase Order Receipt in the list for which you wish
    to capture an Invoice.  

Note you can sort the information in the list using the Column Sort or
Quick Filter functions. It is a good idea to find the name of the
Supplier for whom you wish to capture an invoice.  

4.  Click on the Invoice button on the Form Bar to view a list of
    Invoices that have been captured against this Purchase Order
    Receipt.  

The system will open a screen titled "Invoices for POREC XYZ." This
screen will show a list of all the Invoices that have been captured
against the selected Purchase Order Receipt. If this is the first time
you are capturing an invoice against this Purchase Order Receipt, the
system will obviously list no Purchase Order Receipts.

5.  Click on the Add button on the form bar to open the Add Purchase
    Order Invoice screen.  

The system will display a screen titled "Add Purchase Order Invoice."

This screen consists of three parts, the Header, the Detail and the
Footer.  

The Header is displayed at the top of the screen and displays
information about the Supplier, the transaction numbers, dates,
payment terms, delivery address and son on.  

The Detail is displayed in the middle of the screen in a worksheet or
grid and lists each of the individual items that were delivered by the
Supplier.  

The Footer displays the total value for the order at the bottom of the
screen.  

This screen will automatically list all of the details that were
captured on the Purchase Order Receipt you selected in step 3 above.  

6.  You need to enter the Invoice Number as it appears on the Supplier's
    Invoice in the Transaction No field. Simply overtype the correct
    Supplier Invoice number in this field. Then press the tab key on
    your keyboard.

7.  You can enter a Reference Number, say for a Job or Customer Order if
    this invoice is for a specific order, in the Reference Number field.
    Or you can leave the reference number the same as it was captured on
    the Purchase Order Receipt.  

8.  Note the grid at beneath the Order Header lists the item code, the
    item name and the quantity received for each item as they were
    captured on the Purchase Order Receipt. You need to check that the
    quantity for which you are being invoiced corresponds to the
    quantity that was booked into stock on the Purchase Order Receipt.

9.  Once you are satisfied that the quantity for which you are being
    invoiced matches the quantity that was received, you need to check
    the Unit Cost Price being charged by the supplier.  

10. If you notice a difference, you can change the Unit Price in the
    grid by typing the correct Unit Price in this screen.  

11. Check that the Discount % and Tax % are correct and then check that
    the Amount (Inclusive) on the screen matches the Amount Inclusive on
    the Supplier's Invoice.  

12. Repeat steps 8, 9, 10 and 11 for each item listed on the screen.  

13. Once you are satisfied that you have captured in the details for the
    Supplier Invoice correctly on the system, click the Save and then
    the Close buttons on the form bar.  

14. The system will display a confirmation dialog asking you if you wish
    to activate the Purchase Order Invoice. If you are confident that
    all the information is accurate, click the Yes button.

15. The system will return you to the Purchase Order Invoice screen and
    list all the Invoices that have been captured against the selected
    Purchase Order. Click the Search button on the form bar.

16. To print the Purchase Order Invoice and attach it to the Supplier's
    Invoice Note, click the Print button.  

The system will display the Purchase Order Invoice in the Print
Preview screen.

17. To Print the document as previewed, click the Printer Icon on the
    top left of the screen.  

The system will print the Purchase Order Invoice.  

18. Retrieve the printed Purchase Order Invoice and staple it to the
    original Tax Invoice received from the Supplier and the file these
    two documents.  

19. Once you have completed capturing the receipt, click the Close
    button on the form bar.  

**This is the end of this procedure.**
