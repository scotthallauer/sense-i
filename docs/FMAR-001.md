and the term "**Module**" to refer to the set of functions in the Sense-i software that allows you to perform
that work.

There are several variations of this process, and within each, also several different ways a function or
step in the process can be performed. Each industry has a unique set of rules and procedures that
implement the best way to achieve a result. While the process flowchart above might look simple, the
unique requirements for the industry and for each company are implemented in each of
