3.  Select [ **Yes** ] to load the desired connection(s).  

:::note
Usually the company would have **two** databases:
- The **TEST database** (dB) which is used for training, practice and testing purposes.
- The **LIVE dB** where the actual daily work is done.  

The Database Servers can be connected to in two ways:
- Local Area Network **(LAN) connection** - this when the database server is on same LAN, e.g. Office network.
- **Remote connection** - this when the database server is accessed remotely, e.g. via the internet.

Therefore there are typically four connection options:  
- **Remote** connection to the **LIVE database**
- **Remote** connection to the **TEST database**
- **Local connection** to the **LIVE** database - same **LAN** as that of the Database Server
- **Local connection** to the **TEST** database using the local network to connect to the dB Server.
