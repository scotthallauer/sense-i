## Step-by-step Guideline  
___ 

1.  Click on the **Finance** option on the Main Menu.

2.  Then click the **General Ledger** menu item on the drop down menu.

3.  Then click **G/L Batch**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-1916C/image01.png)  

The system will open a screen titled "Maintain G/L Batch." This screen
displays all the batches that exist in the General Ledger that match
the search criteria you have entered.

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-1916C/image3.jpg)  

The information that is displayed in the grid can be used to select,
sort and organise information about the General Ledger batches.

A.  The system displays the number of the Batch in the G/L Batch column.
    This information is useful for auditing purposes.

B.  The system displays a description of the Batch. This description is
    created by combining the Accounting Period and the Type of
    Transaction in the Batch. This helps you to easily identify a
    batch containing a specific type of transaction.

C.  The system displays the Transaction Type Code that relates to the
    transactions included in the batch in the Transaction Type Code.
    This helps you to quickly identify and select any specific group
    of Transactions you wish to import.

D.  You might for example decide that you want to import and review all
    invoices from suppliers. You would then select the POINV or
    Purchase Order Invoice transaction row.

E.  The name of each Transaction Type is displayed in the Transaction
    Type Name field.

F.  The system indicates whether the Batch was created from Sub-Ledger
    transactions or if it was Manually created in the General Ledger.

G.  The system displays a "Ready to Post Status" in the Ready to Post
    column.

If the "Ready to Post Status" is Yes, then all the journals contained
within the batch balance and contain the information required to be
posted.

If the "Ready to Post Status" is No, then either the underlying
journals are missing information or they do not balance. You will need
to open each batch that has a "Ready to Post Status" of "No", identify
the journals that are problematic and then delete them from the batch.
You will then need to fix the underlying cause of the error and
re-import the transaction that have been deleted for not balancing.

H.  The system will display that Status of the batch in the Status
    column. This will either be "Open" or "Posted."

If the batch status is "Open" then the batch has not yet been posted.
If the Batch is a Manual Batch then you can change any of the
underlying journals or add new ones. If the batch is a batch that has
been created by importing transactions from a subledger, then you will
not be able to add journals, nor change existing journals but you will
be able to delete selected journals.

If the batch status is "Posted" then the batch is no longer open and
has been posted. You cannot add, delete or modify the journals in a
posted batch.

I.  The Total Financial Value of all the Transactions in the batch
    (Inclusive of Tax Amount where Tax is applicable) is displayed in
    the Batch Total column. You can use this to compare the Total
    Value that will be created in the General Ledger Batch for the
    Accounting Period to a list of the Transaction on which the Batch
    has been created. In our example above, you could print a list of
    all the Purchase Order Invoices captured in the system for the
    selected period and compare the total on the printed list to the
    total on the Maintain Sub-Ledger Import screen.

J.  The system displays the number of transactions that are included in
    the Batch in the No of Journals column.

K.  The system displays information that is useful for auditing purposes
    in the Audit Band. This includes the name of the user who created
    the batch, the date on which the batch was created. If the batch
    has been posted, the system displays the name of the user who
    posted the batch and the date on which the batch was posted. You
    can use this information to monitor and track the source of the
    journal batches and identify any user with whom you need to
    resolve mistakes.

## Using The Quick Filter

You can any of the columns to analyse, filter, group and select the
transaction types with which you wish to work. Use the Quick Search
features that built into the Column Headings on every list screen to
quickly select the rows you need.

4. If you click on the right hand side of most column headings on a
list screen you will notice the system displays a small black arrow
head. If you click on this button the system will display all of the
unique values in the list screen.

This is known as the Quick Filter List. You can click on most column
headings to quickly filter the information listed in the worksheet.

## Ensure The Journals in the GL Batches You Wish To Post Are Correct  

You can only post batches in the General Ledger that contain all the
necessary information and where the total of the debit values match
the total of the credit values in each journal.

In procedure "**Review Imported Batches and Journals**" you
will have identified which batches contain journals that were not
ready to be posted and then in procedure "GEL-009 -- Resolve Errors
with GL Batches and Journals" identified the cause of each of the
problems, resolved them and then re-imported the transactions into the
General Ledger.

At this stage then, there should be no GL Batches or Journals that are
not ready to post. However, you can proceed to post GL Batches that
are ready to post and leave any that are not to be resolved after
posting those that are.

When posting batches in the General Ledger you are usually trying to
finalise the transactions for a specific Accounting Period. So the
first step you should take is to filter the list to show only those
batches for the Accounting Period on which you are focused.

You can use the Quick Filter to do this.

5.  In the Period Information band, click the Quick Filter arrow in the
    Accounting Period column. Then click on the Accounting Period on
    which you wish to focus.

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-1916C/image7.jpg)  

The system will then reduce the records displayed in the grid to show
only those batches that match the Accounting Period you have selected.

6.  Next, you should sort the batches into those that are Ready to Post
    and those that are not. To do this, click the Ready to Post Column.
    The system will sort the batches into those that are Not Ready to
    Post and then those that are Ready to Post.

7.  Click on the row that contains the next GL Batch you wish to Post.

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-1916C/image9.jpg)  

The system will Post the batch you have selected and change the Status
from "Open" to "Posted" and also change the Ready to Post to blank.

9.  Repeat steps 7 and 8 for each GL Batch that you wish to Post.

:::note
Once you Post a Batch you cannot change any information in
the batch. There is an Administrator utility called the GL Posted
Batch Delete function that will allow you to Delete a Posted Batch.
This function will delete all the journals in a specified batch that
has been posted and will recalculate all the balances in the General
Ledger.  
:::

:::warning G/L Posted Batch Delete function
**This function should be used very rarely and only in specific
circumstances**.  
Ask you Administrator if you think you need to delete a Posted GL
Batch.
:::

10. Once you have completed posting the GL Batches you wish to post,
    click on the Close button to close the Maintain G/L Batch screen.

The system will close the screen and return you to the main screen in
the program.

**This is the end of the procedure.**
