## Activate Sales Quote (SOE-003)
### Procedure Guideline
___

1.  You would use this procedure whenever you wanted to indicate to
    other users in the system that the details of the Sales Quote you
    have captured are final. Some Sales Quotes are saved with a Status
    of Provisional. For these Quotes it is necessary to change the
    status to Active so that other users who log on to the system know
    that the Quote is correct and complete and is unlikely to change.
    For Quotes that were activated when they were saved this procedure
    is not necessary.

1.  Click on the **Customer** bar on the Main Navigation Menu at the top of the screen.

1.  Then select **Sales Quote** option from the drop-down Menu.

4.  The system will open a screen titled **"Maintain Sales Quote".**  


This screen lists all the Sales Quotes that have already been captured in the system within the ***From Date*** and ***To Date*** specified in the Search Criteria Panel.  

:::note
You can change the information displayed in this list by changing the dates and other information in the Search Criteria Panel above the list of orders.

### Search

5.  You can search for the specific Sales Quote you wish to Activate by
    selecting the Customer from the list of customers. To do this, click
    on the three dot button in the Customer Name field. The system will
    display the Customer List screen immediately underneath this field.

1.  Search for a specific Customer and then click the select button.

1.  Then click the Search button on the Form Bar.

1.  The system will display a list of all Sales Quotes that match the
    Customer Name you have selected.

1.  If you do not find the Sales Quote you wish to Activate, then
    perhaps the From and To Date you have selected filters the quote out
    of the list and you may need to change these dates.

1. Click on the Sales Quote in the list of Quotes that the system
    displays in the grid.

1. Click the Activate Button on the Form Bar.

1. The system will present an information dialogue asking you if you
    are sure you wish to Activate the selected Sales Quote. Click Yes to
    accept this.

1. Click the Search Button on the Form Bar.

1. The system will refresh the information displayed in the grid. If
    your monitor is wide enough you will see the Status column in the
    grid. If not you will need to scroll to the right. You will then
    notice that the status of the Sales Quote has been updated to show
    that has changed from Provisional to Active. This means that the
    Sales Quote is now finalised and will be sent to the Customer. Other
    users can now rely on the information in this quote as firm and know
    that it will not change.

1. You can also simply right click the mouse on the Sales Quote in the
    list and select Activate.

1. Once you have Activated the Sales Quote you can choose to Print or
    Email it. See the procedure ...?

**This is the end of this procedure.**
